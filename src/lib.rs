/// Create a channel with a maximum capacity.

/// Create a bounded channel with a [`Sender`] and [`Receiver`] connected to each end
/// respectively. Values sent in one end of the channel will be received on the other end. The
/// channel is thread-safe, and both sender and receiver may be sent to threads as necessary. In
/// addition, [`Sender`] may be cloned.
///
/// Unlike an [`unbounded`] channel, if there is no space left for new messages, calls to
/// [`Sender::send`] will block (unblocking once a receiver has made space). If blocking behaviour
/// is not desired, [`Sender::try_send`] may be used.
///
/// # Examples
/// ```
/// let (tx, rx) = flume::bounded(32);
///
/// for i in 1..33 {
///     tx.send(i).unwrap();
/// }
/// assert!(tx.try_send(33).is_err());
///
/// assert_eq!(rx.try_iter().sum::<u32>(), (1..33).sum());
/// ```
